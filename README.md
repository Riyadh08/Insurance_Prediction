# Insurance Premium Prediction

This project aims to predict insurance premiums using various machine learning models. After evaluating multiple models, the Random Forest model was chosen due to its high accuracy.

## Models Used

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Random Forest**

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated based on their accuracy. The Random Forest model outperformed the others, achieving the highest accuracy.

## Final Model

The Random Forest model was selected as the final model for predicting insurance premiums. The model was trained on the dataset and then saved for future use.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
